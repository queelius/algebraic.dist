\title{Moment-Matching Normal Approximation}
\usage{
normal_approx(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{dist} object to approximate.}
}
\value{
A \code{normal} distribution (for univariate inputs) or an
\code{mvn} distribution (for multivariate inputs) with the same
mean and variance-covariance as \code{x}.
}
\description{
Constructs a normal (or multivariate normal) distribution that matches
the mean and variance-covariance of the input distribution. This is
useful as a quick Gaussian approximation for any distribution whose
first two moments are available.
