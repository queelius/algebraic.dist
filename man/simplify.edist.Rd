\title{Method for simplifying an \code{edist} object.}
\usage{
\method{simplify}{edist}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The \code{edist} object to simplify}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass (not used)}
}
\value{
The simplified distribution, or unchanged \code{edist} if no rule applies
}
\description{
Attempts to reduce expression distributions to closed-form distributions
when mathematical identities apply. For example:
\itemize{
\item normal + normal = normal (sum of independent normals)
\item normal - normal = normal (difference of independent normals)
}
}
