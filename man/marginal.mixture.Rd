\title{Marginal distribution of a mixture.}

\method{marginal}{mixture}(x, indices)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{mixture} object.}

\item{indices}{Integer vector of variable indices to keep.}
}
\value{
A \code{mixture} object with marginalized components.

\description{
The marginal of a mixture is itself a mixture of the component marginals
with the same mixing weights:
