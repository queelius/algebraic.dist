\description{
support is a class that represents the support of a random
element or distribution, i.e. the set of values that it realize.

It's a conceptual class. To satisfy the concept of
a support, the following methods must be implemented:
\enumerate{
\item has: a function that returns a logical vector indicating
whether each value in a vector is contained in the support
\item infimum: a function that returns the infimum of the support
\item supremum: a function that returns the supremum of the support
\item dim: a function that returns the dimension of the support
}

We provide two implementations that satisfy the concept:
\itemize{
\item \code{interval}: a support that is an infiite set of contiguous numeric values
\item \code{finite_set}: a support that is a finite set of values
Determine if a value is contained in the support.
}
}
