\title{Expectation operator applied to \code{object} of type \code{dist}
with respect to a function \code{g}. That is, \code{E(g(object))}.}
\usage{
\method{expectation}{dist}(x, g = function(t) t, ..., n = 10000L, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{dist} object}

\item{g}{characteristic function of interest, defaults to identity}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to \code{g}}

\item{n}{number of sample points, larger samples reduce variance}

\item{alpha}{significance level for the confidence interval}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
value - The estimate of the expectation
ci    - The confidence interval
n     - The number of samples
}
\description{
We use the CLT to construct a CI(\code{alpha}) for the estimate of the
expectation. That is, we estimate \code{E(g(object))} with the sample mean
and Var(g(object)) with the sigma^2/n, where sigma^2 is the sample
variance of g(object) and n is the number of samples. From these,
we construct the CI.
