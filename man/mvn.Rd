\title{Construct a multivariate or univariate normal distribution object.}
\usage{
mvn(mu, sigma = diag(length(mu)))
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{A numeric vector specifying the means of the distribution.
If \code{mu} has length 1, a univariate normal distribution is created.
If \code{mu} has length > 1, a multivariate normal distribution is created.}

\item{sigma}{A numeric matrix specifying the variance-covariance matrix of the
distribution. It must be a square matrix with the same number of
rows and columns as the length of \code{mu}. Default is the identity
matrix of size equal to the length of \code{mu}.}
}
\value{
If \code{mu} has length 1, it returns a \code{normal} object. If \code{mu} has length
> 1, it returns an \code{mvn} object. Both types of objects contain \code{mu}
and \code{sigma} as their properties.
}
\description{
This function constructs an object representing a normal distribution.
If the length of the mean vector \code{mu} is 1, it creates a univariate
normal distribution. Otherwise, it creates a multivariate normal distribution.
}
\examples{
# Bivariate normal with identity covariance
X <- mvn(mu = c(0, 0))
mean(X)
vcov(X)

# 1D case returns a normal object
is_normal(mvn(mu = 1, sigma = matrix(4)))
}
