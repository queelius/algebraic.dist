\title{Method for obtaining g(x)) where x is a \code{dist} object.}
\usage{
\method{rmap}{dist}(x, g, n = 10000L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The distribution object.}

\item{g}{The function to apply to the distribution.}

\item{n}{The number of samples to generate for the MC estimate of the
conditional distribution x | P. Defaults to 10000.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass into \code{g}.}
}
\description{
We just sample from \code{x} and place the sample in \code{empirical_dist} and
then apply \code{rmap} with \code{g} to it.
}
