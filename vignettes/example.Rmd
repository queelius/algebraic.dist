## Introduction
To demonstrate the R package `algebraic.dist`, we consider 
the multivariate normal distribution (MVN) and its empirical
approximation.

We start by loading the package:
```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
library(algebraic.dist)
```

## Defining the data generating process
We define the parameters of the data generating process (DGP)
with:
```{r data-gen}
# we define the parameters of the MVN
M <- mvn(mu = 1:5, sigma = diag(1:5))
print(M)
```

Each observation is an i.i.d. vector from the MVN.
We sample from the MVN with:
```{r data-gen2}
# we generate a sample of size n
n <- 100000

# we sample from the MVN
data <- sampler(M)(n)
```

We have a sample of size $n=`r n`$ from the DGP.
We show some observations from this sample with:
```{r}
head(data, n=6)
```

Now, we also construct a empirical distribution from the sample with:
```{r emp-construction}
emp <- empirical_dist(data)
print(emp)
```

Let's show the supports of the empirical distribution and the MVN:
```{r support}
# generate a data frame with the dimension, supremum,
# and infimum of the MVN and empirical distribution
df <- data.frame(supremum.mvn = supremum(sup(M)),
                 supremum.emp = supremum(sup(emp)),
                 infimum.mvn = infimum(sup(M)),
                 infimum.emp = infimum(sup(emp)))
row.names(df) <- paste0("param",1:dim(sup(M)))
print(df)
```

Let's compare the mean and covariance-variance matrices of both the MVN and the
empirical distribution of the MVN. First, let's look at the means.
```{r compare-basic-stats}
mean(M)
mean(emp)
```
As expected, pretty close. Now let's look at the variance-covariance:
```{r compare-basic-stats2}
vcov(M)
vcov(emp)
```

The true variances of the population defined by the MVN $M$ is the diagonal of the
variance-covariance matrix:
```{r}
diag(vcov(M))
```

Let's compute the variances using the general expectation method:
```{r}
mu.emp <- mean(emp)
expectation(emp, function(x) (x - mu.emp)^2)
expectation(M, function(x) (x - mean(M))^2, control = list(n = n))
```

We see that these are pretty good estimates, as the expectation is actually a
Monte Carlo approximation. We can see the CI's with:
```{r}
expectation(emp, function(x) (x - mu.emp)^2, control = list(compute_stats = TRUE))
expectation(M, function(x) (x - mean(M))^2, control = list(n = n, compute_stats = TRUE))
```

Next, we use the `rmap` function on the MVN and the empirical distribution to compute
the distribution of $(X - E(X))^2$. If we take the mean of this, we should get the
variance as shown above:
```{r rmap}
mu.emp <- mean(emp)
mean(rmap(emp, function(x) (x - mu.emp)^2))
mean(rmap(M, function(x) (x - mean(M))^2, n = n))
```
These are both reasonable estimates of the variance.

The PDF of the empirical is not very useful -- it gets $1/n$ for each observation:
```{r}
x <- sampler(emp)(1)
y <- sampler(M)(1)
data.frame(
  ob = c("empirical(x)", "MVN(y)"),
  pdf.emp = c(density(emp)(x), density(emp)(y)),
  pdf.mvn = c(density(M)(x), density(M)(y)))
```

Let's plot the CDF of marginal distribution of $X_1$:
```{r marginal-test, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
X1.emp <- marginal(emp, 1)
F1.emp <- cdf(X1.emp)
curve(F1.emp(x), from = infimum(sup(X1.emp)), to = supremum(sup(X1.emp)), col = "blue", lty = 1)
X1 <- marginal(M, 1)
F1 <- cdf(X1)
curve(F1(x), from = infimum(sup(X1.emp)), to = supremum(sup(X1.emp)), add = TRUE, col = "red", lty = 2)
legend("topleft", legend = c("empirical", "MVN"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = c(1, 2))
```

Given the sample size, the empirical distribution's CDF is essentially the same
as the MVN's CDF (they're right on top of each other). Let's zoom in much closer
so we can ee that the empirical CDF is a step function:
```{r marginal-test-zoom, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
curve(F1.emp(x), from = 1, to = 1.0005, col = "blue", lty = 1, type = "s")
```

Let's compute some expectations of $X_1$:
```{r expectation-test}
cat("E(X1) = ", expectation(X1, function(x) x), "( expected ", mean(X1), ")\n",
    "Var(X1) = ", expectation(X1,
                              function(x) {
                                  (x - expectation(X1,
                                                   function(x) x)
                                  )^2 
                              }),
    "( expected ", vcov(X1), ")\n",
    "Skewness(X1) = ", expectation(X1,
                                   function(x) {
                                       (x - expectation(X1, function(x) x))^3 / 
                                       expectation(X1, function(x) x)^3 
                                   }),
    "( expected 0 )\n",
    "E(X^2) = ", expectation(X1, function(x) x^2),
    "( expected ", vcov(X1) + mean(X1)^2, ")")
```

Let's show a scatter plot of the joint distribution of $X_2$ and $X_4$:
```{r joint-marginal-test, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
dataX2X4.emp <- sampler(marginal(emp, c(2, 4)))(10000)
dataX2X4.mvn <- sampler(marginal(M, c(2, 4)))(10000)

# scatter plot a 2d sample. use xlab and ylab to label the axes
plot(dataX2X4.emp[,1], dataX2X4.emp[,2], pch = 20, col = "blue", xlab = "X2", ylab = "X4")
# overlay in green the MVN data
points(dataX2X4.mvn[,1], dataX2X4.mvn[,2], pch = 20, col = "green")
legend("topright", legend = c("empirical", "MVN"), col = c("blue", "green"), pch = c(20, 20))
title("Scatter plot of X2 and X4")
```

Let's look at the MVN's multivariate CDF:
```{r multivariate-cdf}
cdf(M)(c(1,2,3,4,0))
```

Now we show the mean of the conditional distribution, $X | X_1 + X_2 < 0$:
```{r conditional-test}
mean(conditional(emp, function(x) x[1] + x[2] < 0))
mean(conditional(M, function(x) x[1] + x[2] < 0))
```
I didn't do the analysis of what this distribution's mean should theoretically be,
if it's even practical to derive, but it doesn't look unreasonable. We see that the
mean of the first two components are negative, which makes sense: the sum of the
first two components is negative, so the mean of the first two components should
be negative.




## Working with `edist` Objects

The `edist` object is a key component of the `algebraic.dist` package. It represents a distribution that is an algebraic expression of other distributions.

### Creating `edist` Objects

You can create an `edist` object using the `edist` function. Here's an example:

```{r}
e <- edist(expression(x + y),
           list("x" = normal(mu = 0, var = 1),
                "y" = exponential(rate = 1)))
```

This creates an `edist` object representing the distribution of the sum of a normal
random variable and an exponential random variable.

### Printing `edist` Objects
You can print an `edist` object to see its expression and the distributions of its
variables:

```{r}
print(e)
```

### Mean and Variance of `edist` Objects

You can compute the mean and variance of an `edist` object using the
`mean` and `vcov` functions:

```{r}
mean(e)
vcov(e)
```

### Sampling from `edist` Objects

You can generate a sample from an edist object using the sampler method:
```{r}
s <- sampler(e)
samp <- s(10)  # Generate a sample of size 10
print(samp)
```

This concludes our overview of the `edist` object. It's a powerful tool
for working with algebraic expressions of distributions, and we hope
you find it useful in your statistical analyses.

### Computing the PDF of `edist` Objects

You can compute the PDF of an `edist` object using the `density` function:
