Description: Provides an algebra over probability distributions enabling
    composition, sampling, and automatic simplification to closed forms.
    Supports normal, exponential, multivariate normal, and empirical
    distributions with operations like addition and subtraction that
    automatically simplify when mathematical identities apply (e.g., the
    sum of independent normal distributions is normal). Uses S3 classes for
    distributions and R6 for support objects.
